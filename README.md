# `@fabianmewes-jm/fabee-pi-agent`

`@fabianmewes-jm/fabee-pi-agent` is the forked npm package for the
`bee-pi-agent` Bee Dance speaking worker runtime. It executes coding-agent
turns over a local Unix socket.

It is intended to sit behind `@jobmatchme/bee-worker-sidecar`: the agent speaks
Bee Dance envelopes locally, while the sidecar handles NATS-facing transport and
subject routing.

## What this package does

- listens on a Unix socket for framed Bee Dance envelopes
- responds to `protocol.hello` with `protocol.welcome`
- accepts `turn.start` and `turn.cancel` commands
- executes turns with the familiar `pi-*` coding-agent tool stack
- emits Bee Dance event envelopes such as `run.started`, `item.appended`,
  `item.updated`, `run.completed`, and `run.failed`

## What this package does not do

- no direct NATS connection
- no Slack transport or Slack formatting
- no gateway responsibilities

## Design intent

The package is the local execution half of a two-container pod shape:

- `bee-pi-agent` owns agent execution and local state
- `bee-worker-sidecar` owns NATS connectivity and Bee subject routing

In this fork, the published npm package name is
`@fabianmewes-jm/fabee-pi-agent`, while the runtime binary and several runtime
identifiers still use the established `bee-pi-agent` naming.

That keeps the agent reusable for deployments that want Bee Dance semantics
without forcing every worker implementation to speak NATS directly.

## Upstream provenance

This package is derived in part from
[`pi-mom`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/mom) by Mario
Zechner. The upstream package is MIT licensed, and selected files in this
package were copied or adapted under that license.

See [UPSTREAM.md](./UPSTREAM.md) for file-level provenance details.

## Socket protocol

`bee-pi-agent` exchanges framed Bee Dance envelopes over a Unix socket. The
expected local flow is:

- sidecar sends `protocol.hello`
- agent replies with `protocol.welcome`
- sidecar sends `turn.start`
- agent streams event envelopes back on the same socket
- sidecar may send `turn.cancel`

The default socket path is `/var/run/bee/worker.sock`.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run build
BEE_PI_AGENT_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/workspace \
BEE_PI_AGENT_SOCKET=/tmp/fabee-pi-agent.sock \
node dist/main.js
```

## Environment

Primary variables:

- `BEE_PI_AGENT_WORKSPACE_ROOT` required workspace root for this worker instance
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_WORKSPACE_CWD` optional working directory inside the workspace
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_STATE_DIR` optional worker state directory
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_MEMORY_FILE` optional memory file path
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_SKILLS_DIR` optional skills directory path
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_SANDBOX` optional `host` or `docker:<container>`
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_DOCKER_WORKSPACE_ROOT` optional visible workspace root inside docker, default `/workspace`
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_APPEND` optional additional fixed instructions
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_BLOB_STORE_ROOT` optional blob-store root for attachments and artifacts
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_AUTH_FILE` optional auth file override
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_MODEL_PROVIDER` optional provider override
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_MODEL_ID` optional model override
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_TOOL_MODULES` optional comma-separated extra tool modules
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_DBT_PROJECT_DIR` optional dbt project directory for the built-in `dbt` tool
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_DBT_PROFILES_DIR` optional dbt profiles directory for the built-in `dbt` tool
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_DBT_COMMAND` optional dbt executable path or command name for the built-in `dbt` tool
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_DBT_TARGET` optional default dbt target for the built-in `dbt` tool
- `BEE_PI_AGENT_SOCKET` optional Unix socket path, default `/var/run/bee/worker.sock`

For OAuth-backed OpenAI usage with a `pi-ai` `auth.json`, use
`BEE_PI_AGENT_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai-codex`. Plain `openai` expects an API key
based provider flow instead.

For migration convenience, the older `PI_AGENT_WORKER_*` variables are still
accepted as fallbacks.

## Built-in dbt tool

The worker now includes a built-in `dbt` tool so the agent can:

- list models and analyses via `dbt list`
- preview model output via `dbt show --select ...`
- execute inline SQL via `dbt show --inline ...`
- run targeted `dbt build`, `compile`, `run`, `test`, and `parse`

For reliable operation outside a dbt repo, set:

```bash
BEE_PI_AGENT_DBT_PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/dbt-project
BEE_PI_AGENT_DBT_PROFILES_DIR=/path/to/dbt-profiles-dir
BEE_PI_AGENT_DBT_COMMAND=/path/to/dbt
BEE_PI_AGENT_DBT_TARGET=dev
```

If `BEE_PI_AGENT_DBT_COMMAND` is not set, the tool tries a local `.venv/bin/dbt` first and then falls back to `dbt` on `PATH`.

## Docker image

A Dockerfile is included for runtime image builds. Build it locally with:

```bash
docker build -t fabee-pi-agent:local .
```

In this fork, the Docker image is built directly from the repository source.
The release flow does not require publishing the npm package first.

The image is designed to be paired with `bee-worker-sidecar` in the same pod.

## Helm chart

This repo currently still contains a reusable Helm chart under
[`charts/bee-pi-agent`](./charts/bee-pi-agent).
The chart deploys:

- one `bee-pi-agent` container
- one `bee-worker-sidecar` container
- one shared socket volume mounted at `/var/run/bee`

It also supports the same workspace, auth, and git bootstrap patterns that were
used in the earlier `pi-agent-worker` deployment.

Note: the chart path and chart naming in this repository still use
`bee-pi-agent`. A chart-level rename to `fabee-pi-agent` is not yet implemented
here.
